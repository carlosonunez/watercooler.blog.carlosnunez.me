i had an iPhone 13 mini for a year before reluctantly upgrading to the iPhone 15
Pro. between it having usb-c and the mini being discontinued, i figured it was
time.

i went back to my mini two months later.

aside from travel apps, music, myfitnesspal and logging receipts to expensify, i
don't use my phone very much. quite the contrary; i wish i could use it less.
something like [the light phone](https://www.thelightphone.com) with just enough
functionality to fit my use case would be perfect.

the mini is the perfect phone for me. i love how it fits comfortably in one
hand and is light enough to hold for extended periods of time. i also enjoy it
being small enough to fit in my pants pockets or [fanny
packs](https://www.patagonia.com/product/ultralight-black-hole-mini-hip-pack-1-liter/195699685444.html)
without bulging.

(ironically, while the iPhone 15 Pro had more capable cameras, i've
taken more photos with my mini because of how easy it is to retrieve and use.)

i was saddened by apple's decision to stop producing the mini. while i

it sucks that there are essentially no options for people who don't need big
phones.

oh well. anyway.
