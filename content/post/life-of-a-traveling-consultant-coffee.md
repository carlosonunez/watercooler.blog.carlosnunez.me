TL;DR: If you're like and demand great coffee no matter where you're traveling
to, learn how to do pour-overs and bring a kit with you.

<hr />

Having good coffee is really important to me.

As someone that travels a lot throughout the year, access to good coffee on the
road is harder than you'd think.

## there's good

When I'm home, I brew with an Origami Dripper and Chemex filters. I used to use
Hario filters since that's The Standardâ„¢ for V60 brews, but I've found that
the Chemex filters remove a lot of the harsh oils that coat my throat after
a session without sacrificing flavor.

I get my beans (always single origin) from
[BlendIN Coffee Roasters](https://blendincoffeeclub.com here in Houston, which
I'm okay with because they prevent me from going full snob by being infinitely
better at coffee than I'll ever be.

The beans are ground with a Fellow Ode Gen 1
Conical Burr Grinder. I've considered replacing the blades for a more dialed-in
grind, but that feels like a lot of work for maybe 5% improvement in clarity and
flavor and I'm lazy, so no.

Why, yes, thanks for asking, I'm almost forgot; of course I use my own distilled
water treated with Aquacode's mineral mix. I haven't measured the water's purity
but the TDS meter is in the mail. And, to close this loop of absolute
pretentiousness that I felt kind of disgusting putting to print, I use a
Fellow Stagg EKG kettle...with Wi-Fi, because I do computery things and why the
fuck not. (The Wi-Fi adds basically nothing to the kettle. Not worth the extra
cost.)

## and then there is "good"

I obviously can't bring this stuff with me, as I would need a huge bag to bring
it in and the TSA would probably flag it to [allow some senator's gun to go
through or
something](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2023/10/24/washington-senator-jeff-wilson-gun-hong-kong-arrested).

Consequently, I lower my "good" bar a lot when I'm traveling.

In this context, "good" means "not a bitter cup of stale water with spent
grounds on the bottom to remind you of what you're drinking."

Getting good coffee is hard because I'm just as likely to get hit with the
coffee equivalent of a warm Miller Lite [^0] at a random gas station[^1] as I am at
a $250/head client dinner.

Sometimes I'm working in a city that has numerous excellent coffee shops that
brew actual pour over coffee and not espresso-based sugar milkshakes [^2]. Those
are great, and I'm thankful when I'm in that situation. but in the battle
between patroning the shop for a good cuppa and "your client threw an 8AM
on-site meeting on your calendar and you're 30 minutes away, and it's 7:15", the
client's gonna win (or get mad if you told them you were late because you
stopped at a coffee shop for their rare Indonesian single-origin that just
dropped).

So I did a thing.

## yes, i'm that guy

{{< figure src="/images/life-of-coffee/coffee_kit.JPG" >}}

I bring my own pour over kit. The picture above is an old version of my portable
coffee setup.

Yes, I'm that guy. I'm an absolute riot at parties.

Here's my setup. Hope it helps you if you're thinking of doing something
similar.

### bom

- **Kettle**: [LOUTYUO Portable Collapsible
  Kettle](https://www.amazon.com/LOUTYTUO-Ultrathin-Upgraded-Protection-Separable/dp/B07ZFKCYLZ). I've tried to find a kettle that isn't from an anonymous
  [offshore seller on Amazon](../frupidity), but this is the best I could do. It
  boils water and has a short spout. Good enough. It will even reheat the water
  once its temperature reaches 165 deg F. _$41_.
- **Thermometer**: [KIZEN Digital Meat Thermometer with
  Probe](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085164V1X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
  Built-in thermometers on kettles can be crazy inaccurate. This can result in a
  bad extraction which throws off flavor. Using a probe thermometer helps a lot
  with this. I leave it dipped in the kettle above as water's boiling, with the
  lid closed, of course. _$16_
- **Dripper**: [SOTO Helix Coffee
  Maker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HUIWK1W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
  Finding a dripper was difficult. There are a lot of silicone drippers out
  there, but they take up a lot of space and have bad flow (or at least the one
  I had did). I like this dripper because it's metal, has a hole at the bottom
  of the cone like a traditional V60, and collapses really thinly into itself.
  It's not strong enough to support the Hario Drip Assist I use (below), but
  the positives outweigh that negative. Also, super easy to clean. Rinse and
  you're done. _$19_
- **Drip Assist**: [Hario Drip
  Assist](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XBJNVQH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
  _$19_. I love this thing, but it requires some explanation.

  Because the kettle has a short spout, it is very difficult
  to control water turbulence over the grounds. I've found that this can cause
  fines to clog up within the compacted grounds, leading to overextraction and
  bitterness.

  The Drip Assist solves that by having two flow-controlling reservoirs around
  it: one in the center with a bigger hole for fast flow during the initial
  bloom and an outer one with smaller holes for a controlled soak.

  The end result is a theoretically-consistent cup of coffee regardless of the
  conditions the cup was poured in. Which is exactly what I get most of the
  time.
- **Filters**: Hario #2 filters. You can find these anywhere. Melitta filters,
  which are more common, work as well.
- **Grinder**: [VSSL Coffee
  Grinder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ZNWW8PL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
  The star of the show. It's a burr grinder with 50 grind settings in a
  stainless steel, super easy to use package. The thing is indestructible and
  grinds an mostly-even set of grounds with very little effort (aside from
  hand-cranking the grind). My only complaint is that the grind size adjustment
  knob has no markers telling you where it is, so the only way to know what
  grind size you're going to get if you change it is to do a test grind
  beforehand. this wastes coffee. _$160_
- **Dopp Bag**: [Cotopaxi
  Nido](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/nido-accessory-bag-del-dia). Super
  functional Dopp bag. Neatly organizes everything and fits all of this stuff
  nice and compactly. Nobody will know that you're a complete coffee snob
  asshole until you open the bag. Well worth the purchase. $40.
- **Water**: Yeah, I don't treat my water when I'm on a trip. Too difficult to
  get distilled water in anything less than a gallon, and all of the solutions
  are packaged for use in a gallon or more. Instead, I purchase a few bottles of
  bottled water at a gas station (they always have them). You can get, like, 24
  for $5. If you're spending more than that,  you're probably getting jipped.
- **Scale**: [Joseph Joseph Tri
  Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-40071-TriScale-Compact-Folding/dp/B0091QO41U?pd_rd_w=52L2Q&content-id=amzn1.sym.904ca806-5e87-42cf-86b8-c792f6d660bd&pf_rd_p=904ca806-5e87-42cf-86b8-c792f6d660bd&pf_rd_r=Y3WXJ9XPT0Z5MNEVRG08&pd_rd_wg=qHw0N&pd_rd_r=e1362ad0-0bdd-45ea-aacb-1167c77df8ce&pd_rd_i=B0091QO41U&psc=1&ref_=pd_bap_d_grid_rp_0_1_ec_t). Absoute legend of a scale. Folds up
  super nice, is reasonably accurate, and doesn't try to be more than it is.
  Also good for folks that track calories/food consumption. You can put it in
  your pocket and sneak in a weigh-in without 30 minutes of the "oh, so you're
  dieting" conversation. _$33_

### honorary mentions

#### aeropress go

I started with an
[AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-go-travel-coffee-press), of
course. I wasn't happy with it, though. Several reasons.

First, it takes up a lot of space. The Go is "portable" in the sense
that the original takes up a fuckton of space (relatively speaking). Both are
still demanding space-wise.

Second, I wasn't a fan of the overly bold coffee it would produce. I couldn't
find a way of controlling for this outside of adjusting grind size. The coffee
always came out too bold for my liking.

Third, the Go only produces 8oz of coffee and I usually drink 12oz.


Fourth, and most importantly, is that the AeroPress exploded on me once
while I was using the [inverted
method](https://samplecoffee.com.au/brewguides/inverted-aeropress).

Grounds went FUCKING EVERYWHERE.

It was a disaster, and getting a new hotel room was a whole ass ordeal that I'd
prefer to not repeat. Yes, you can get a
[Prismo](https://fellowproducts.com/products/prismo/0) (_$36_) to solve _that_
problem, but that's more hardware that you have to clean and I only carry one
bag.

#### silicone drippers

The first dripper I got was a silicon dripper. Hario filters didn't fit well
(though I think Kalitta Wave filters would have worked) and because it only
had two small holes on the bottom, flow was pretty bad when the water got backed
up. Also, space.

#### giving up and using hotel coffee

_triggered_

Not happening. Here's why.

1. You can't guarantee the kind of coffee maker your room will come with. Will
   it come with a cheap old plastic CVT maker that hasn't been cleaned since
   Sheratons were still in style? Or will you get a NESPRESSO machine with some
   decent pods? You have no idea, and your travel booking software doesn't
   either, most of the time.
2. THEY NEVER GET CLEANED. Ever. So you're going to spend _at least_ five
   minutes running hot water through the coffee maker to try and get maybe 40%
   of the cruft out. You'd definitely need vinegar for the job, but you got into
   your hotel room at 11pm because your earlier flight was delayed and all you
   had was Panda Express and a hope of a nice evening that was robbed from you.
   No, you're not getting fucking vinegar, and you still have that on-site
   meeting at 8AM.
3. [1] and [2] apply to the coffee downstairs in the breakfast area, though that
   coffee is usually better. Usually. Sometimes.
4. I don't know...pouring over my coffee is fun? It's nice to bring home
   traditions with you, even if they're small. You're already on the road
   sacrificing so much; simple things like this remind you of why you're
   doing this.


## Footnotes

[^0]: or cold. sorry, kind of
[^1]: major gas station chains are the exception. their coffee is usually great.
if you see a bucee's, love's/flying j, qt, racetrac or wawa, you're in good
hands. also, their breakfasts are fucking incredible. they know how to take your
money. marathon and basically any "tiger mart" in the nyc metro can get fucked
though. trash.
[^2]: no disrespect to those coffee shops. running a coffee shop in a
world where
starbucks just exists is unbelievably hard, and i know that the margins are
crazy thin in that industry as it is. however, i hope you can agree that it's
pretty disappointing to visit a coffee shop that looks upscale and has The Fancy
Espresso Machinesâ„¢ that doesn't do pour overs and has drip coffee that is a touch
above dunkin donuts.
