I purchased a Thuma two weeks ago to replace our suddenly-broken bed frame.

Interestingly, I had _no idea_ that they were all over TV and people's socials.
I learned about the company upon searching "best bed frame site:reddit.com"
on Google.

(Were these posts part of Thuma's super-thirsty ad campaigns? Hard to
tell these days!)

This bed is the real deal.

I hate assembling stuff. If its manual is more complicated than an IKEA
chair, I pretty much avoid it.

I would gladly put this bed together any day of the week.

It comes in three heavy-ass boxes. If you have stairs...well, free leg day I
guess.

Taking the boards out of the boxes and flattening them afterwards was the
hardest part of this setup. So there's that.

The board literally snaps together like a puzzle. Unlike puzzles, every
connector is idiot-proof, and, unlike almost every piece of furniture on Earth,
the renderings in the guide are actually accurate.

It took me ten minutes to assemble the entire bed. Okay, 12 if you count moving
the **extremely shockingly heavy** slats.

I wish everything was like this. Putting this together was meditative. I wasn't
expecting that sort of experience.

Last thing.

**THIS BED IS A FUCKING TANK.**

The guide tells you to build the bed frame where you want it. This is
incredibly important. Moving the bed after the fact will be really, really,
REALLY hard. gg if you assembled it on carpet. (For my hardwood floor gang: The
legs have felt pads. They _probably_ won't destroy your floors.)

Anyway. I LOVE THIS BED FRAME. Worth every penny of its (crazy) ~$2000 asking
price.
