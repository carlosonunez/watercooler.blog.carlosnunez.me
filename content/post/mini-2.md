sometime in november, i thought i had enough of my mini. "I need a 120Hz OLED
screen," I said. "The camera button," I said.

so I bought an iPhone 16 Pro. and life was good.

but not for long.

mistaps on the screen while trying to use apps.

playing music errantly while pulling my phone out of my
hip pack.

putting my phone _into_ my hip pack. or anything, really.

the keyboard, now powered by Apple Intelligence™, producing hilariously made-up
words evey.thrd.wrdb.i.Type. [^0]

_unexplicable slowness._

intense frustration while trying to shoot a photo of a bird in a zoo behind a
fence because the world's most advanced camera software does not let you do
manual focus. [^1]

list goes on.

my usage pattern hasn't changed much since [my last foray into the
mini-verse](./mini.md). this phone is still a e-mail packin', bird-identifyin',
language-teachin' supercomputer. (i even browse the web on it less now that i
use android-powered e-readers for this purpose.)

so imagine me discovering that my phone is dead before night-time despite
spending most of its life in my hip pack. every. other. night. i don't even have
slack on my phone! [^2]

what i didn't realize until a workout session wherein i threw my Apple Watch
Ultra II a small distance out of anger is that my phone wasn't the only source
of my unending fountain frustrations with technology writ large!

i quietly seethed in anger every time i used apple pay on my watch and had to
**_very gently_** rotate my wrist to avoid picking the wrong card by accident.

visions of gathering all of my computer wares, packing them into boxes,
organizing them neatly by their inspired "GOD, SHIT, FUCKS" per minute and
lauching them as high into the sky as possible with a trebuchet were summoned
every time i invoked siri by simply flexing my wrist backwards a bit (despite
wearing the watch upside down to have the corwn face away from my hand!).

i'm not an angry person. something had to be done.

after spending an hour thinking through a transition to android and realizing
"wait, that's actually worse," i remembered that the iPhone mini and
_normal_-sized Apple Watch existed. not long after realizing this, I
angry-traded my Ultra in for a Series 10 and _ran_ to Amazon (which [I had
feelings about](./frupidity.md)) to buy two minis, as my iPhone 12 Pro for
work was also numbered.

i'm back to mini everything. i have to charge my watch and phone every day
because the world is now designed for Pros and Ultras. but I am happy. [^3]

in all seriousness, it is disappointing that options for "simple" users who
don't live in their phones are so scant. people who Do Real Work™ without
watching endless videos or social media feeds exist. there are literally dozens
of us. and we'll pay damn nearly anything to have a modern device in a 2018 form
factor.

the best android phone should _not_ be an iPhone 13 mini, but he were are.

[^0]: The keyboard uses a local GPT-2 model instead of a Markov chain for word
    prediction. But don't worry, it is still incredible at guessing exactly what
    you didn't what at the worst possible times.
    [Link](https://jackcook.com/2023/09/08/predictive-text.html). Apple
    Intelligence uses locally-installed and Apple-trained models and cloud-based
    AI services via Differential Privacy to give you notification summaries that
    are not always, but often, completely fucking wrong. And genmojis. _insert
    they are the same picture meme_

[^1]: I paid for Halide to work around this. It's great software, but you can
    see the amount of hacking those poor folks do to work around Apple's API
    limitations. You can see edge detection being done when you use Halide's
    portrait mode, and the results aren't as good. It also loads more slowly,
    thanks, no doubt, to API restrictions. By the way, did you know that you
    can't change the default camera that you slide left to from the lock screen?
    Totally not evidence of anti-trust. No sir.

[^2]: Android has had [Work
    Profiles](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en) for
    ages. At least ten years. It works incredibly. You can literally have a
    separate container for work stuff on your phone that you turn off when the
    day is done. Meanwhile, Apple's version of work profiles is **buying a whole
    ass separate device**, which I, begrudgingly, ended up doing because WFH has
    all but extinguished the last vestiges of work-life divide and I had to
    re-draw the line somewhere.

[^3]: There's a difference between having a phone that is advertised as having a
    long battery life but ultimately doesn't and a phone that _is well known_
    for having shitty battery life. I knew that charging more was a cost to
    minifying my life, but it's a known cost that no-one tries to hide. Funny
    enough, this is how I've felt about iOS and mobile computing in general
    lately: lots of big expectations that mostly work but fall short in
    extremely. Maybe I'll write more about this.
    upsetting ways.
