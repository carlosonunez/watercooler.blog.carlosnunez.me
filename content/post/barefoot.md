i've been spending the last few months trialing
mexican huarache running sandals, the sandals shown above.

getting to the point where i could wear these crazy awesome sandals was a
journey.

i've had insanely flat feet for as long as I can remember. while they aren't rigid
flat feet (where you can't see an arch when your foot is suspended), they are
pancake-flat under load, like the example shown below.

left unattended, flat feet like this can be Very Bad™ for one's kinetic chain.
i'm not a podiatrist, but this is my ELI5 understanding of what "Very Bad™"
means here:

your arch is super important for keeping your ankles, shins and knees aligned
while under load. when the arch isn't there, they compensate in ways that
cause unwanted stress. this leads to osteoarthritis, bunions and other
inconveniences that making mobility difficult later in life.

my parents put me in orthotics very early in life to prevent this. (my first
pair of orthotics were constructed from plaster molds of my feet that an
podiatrist made. podiatrist's NPs use iPads now.)

while this definitely prevented my feet from getting flatter (and my ankles and
knees from running further inwards), this completely eliminated any chance of me
wearing sandals.

not being able to wear sandals didn't bother me much...until I moved to Texas.

seeing everyone, including my wife, being able to take advantage of Basically
Summer for six months out of year (and Diablo Sauce Summer for an extra three)
with super-comfy Birks made me jealous.

so in January 2023, I finally set out to end this once and for all. i decided
to completely rid of my orthotics.

this wasn't the first time I've sworn off from the things. when I first
discovered Reddit in 2013, I stumbled upon /r/BarefootRunning while I was
looking for info on weaning off of orthotics. it was here that I was introduced
to minimalist shoes.

minimalist shoes aim to make you use your feet more actively. they do this
through four key features:

- they incorporate a wide toe box that allow the toes of your feet to fully
  splay out, as they are designed to do,
- they are also "zero drop" or "zero heel", meaning the sole of the shoe is flat
  from heel to toe and your feet are fully planted on the ground,
- they remove cushioning between your feet and the ground to improve stability,
  and...
- **they have no arch support**.

despite not having any arch support, /r/BarefootRunning could not stop talking
about how minimalist shoes **completely** fix flat feet,
**completely without orthotics**. i was hooked and bought the Vibram Five
Fingers shown above.

for months, I ran and walked tons of them. i switched out all of my sneakers for
low-profile tennis shoes. (I only wear [vivobarefoot](https://vivobarefoot.com)
sneakers these days.). living life without orthotics was amazing...until my
right knee started aching. and then screaming.

orthotics were the only thing that would quell the screaming, so I would
ultimately go straight back to them.

the one thing that /r/BarefootRunning didn't talk much about, and the one thing
i didn't learn until _literally this year_ is this: minimalist shoes are good,
but useless when [your feet are
weak](https://www.somastruct.com/guide-to-fix-flat-feet/).

As someone who deadlifts and squats heavy weights and has for years now, this
was a shock to me...but it made total sense when i thought about it.

again, not a podiatrist, so here's my ELI5 level understanding of what was
happening.

almost everyone learns how to walk as kids. walking and running as kids
is what builds up our arches.

however, when kids begin to wear shoes, the shoes offset the work that feet
would normally do, reducing development.

elevated heels reduce tension on the calves and tendons, and
arch supports absorb shock that would normally be captured by ones arch.

as a result, arch development is mostly a function of how much time
they spend barefoot while not wearing shoes (and other factors). put another
way, children who are more at-risk of developing flat feet are much more
likely to have them once they wear shoes.

additionally, your walking gait and standing positions adapt to your shoes
instead of the shoes adapting to your gait and stance.

this is likely why the pain in my right knee always came back.

my right foot is much flatter than my left. consequently, when i walk, my right
foot angles slightly outwards.

because my arches never fully developed, and because i grew up with shoes that
did the work for me, the obvious fix (and the fix that most podiatrists will
prescribe, even today) is to develop custom orthotics that provide more support.

wearing the orthotic eliminates everything, since it provides the support your
shoes were providing for you. however, once you take the support away, your feet
are on their own...and your tendons, ankles, calves, knees, hips, etc.

**all** of these muscles and joints contribute to mobility, and all of them
were too weak to support me, so my body adjusted. i think my right knee twists
outwards whenever my right foot is under load, likely to compensate for weak
calves and ankles. this was probably always a problem, but years and years of
it eventually catch on.

i didn't give up. i was done with orthotics, and if i needed to rebuild
foundational strength to do it, so be it.

i [signed up](https://fixflatfeet.com) for a program that strengthens
flat foot arches. these won't create arches --- that ship has sailed ---
but it will strengthen the low arch I have and the rest of the foot/lower
kinetic chain around them to reduce injuries.

it's been eight months since I've started strengthening my feet, and
eight months since I wore my last orthotic (which I got completely online, since
many podiatrist's offices are kind of slimy; for example, paying $400+ for
orthotics that you can get for $100, and that's all out of your pocket since
American insurance doesn't cover them!). i've walked hundreds of miles since
then. I've even started running again (I am very slow).

while I had a small stint of knee pain during a road trip, it has since disappeared. (i was trying out Correct Toes to attempt at reducing the crazy bunion I have in my right foot. The thought was that having more, well, correct toes would be net-positive long term. My knee did not agree.)

i don't want to jinx it, but i think i am finally free from orthotics. to
celebrate, i bought sandals.

there are tons of minimalist sandals out there. many of them are good. however,
i wanted sandals with a leather foot bed, and my only real options were mexican
huaraches. since they look badass and are not very common, i got myself a few
pairs.

they have been an adjustment (to say the least), but I absolutely love them. i
love how comfortable they are getting as the leather breaks in and molds to my
foot. super cool. they are also amazing to run in, which makes sense given
[the
tribe](https://www.earthrunners.com/pages/tarahumara-huarache-sandals-ultimate-minimalist-footwear)
from which they originated.
