{{< figure src="/images/hello-world/hello.png" >}}

i think aloud a lot. especially when i'm working through a tough problem.

i've done it for as long as i could remember. while it is immensely helpful in
helping me sort things out, most of those thoughts get recirculated into the
air, mixed with other people's lost thoughts somewhere out there.

i've maintained [a professional blog](https://blog.carlosnunez.me) for a number
of years, but i didn't want to intermix it with random shower thoughts because i
wanted to keep it purely technical.

for the longest time, the thoughts i didn't forget to write down went
into reddit. but then it participated in the [Great Enshittification of
2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy), and that
sucked. so i stopped using it about a month before Apollo (RIP) went offline and
have used it since. [0]

prior to that, i kept a journal in a private git repo of interestings I've
encountered, mostly during work. i still use it but often forget to.

prior to _that_, i kept thoughts in Apple Notes (and, of all places, Facebook
Notes). I still use Notes. it's a fantastic app. it just fucking works, a
quality that feels increasingly rare. (i'm two `Sorry, I'm having trouble
understanding right now`s from siri before I sell all of my apple stuff, buy a
flip phone and carry a shotgun to shoot printers if they make funny noises.
but i hate how private it is. while i definitely have notes that the internet
doesn't need to see, many of them are...not that.

so i created this blog. maybe ten years too late, but here it is.

i'll probably move some of my long-form posts from those other platforms here
someday. who knows.

all opinions are my own, etc. etc.

enjoy!

[0] i lied. i still use reddit to search for things from real humans and not
increasingly aggressive seo gpt thirst-spam. however, my reddit consumption is 5
minutes/day (at best) when it used to be **two hours/day** (and that didn't feel
like enough). seriously. quitting reddit was one of the best decisions i ever
made.
